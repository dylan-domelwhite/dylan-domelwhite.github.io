I am a postdoctoral scholar at Vanderbilt University in the Department of Mathematics. I received my Ph.D. in May 2020 from the University of Houston under the advising of Bernhard G. Bodmann. My research focuses on phase retrieval from quantized measurements, but I also am knowledgeable in the fields of frame theory, functional analysis, signal processing, quantum computing, and machine learning/data science. Additionally, I have a lot of teaching experience including courses such as _Mathematical Data Science_, _Advanced Linear Algebra_, and _Probability and Statistics for Engineers_.
